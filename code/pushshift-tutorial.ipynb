      "I am 18. I started an internship in a company that sells premium products. They clearly make a lot of money because of the niche premium product market over here. The owner/managing director lives like a king on the 6th floor with his beautiful 5 star hotel style office room and the rest work on the 4th floor. There are NO engineers in the entire building except the IT guy. No mentors to introduce me to the system. No one to teach me about the business domain.\n",
      "First when i went for the interview, they said that they want me to intern with them, but first I will have to present to the owner why and how data is important for businesses. I thought \"fine they want me to convince them why my position will hold value in their company\".  Remember I haven't been hired yet. He really liked the presentation and hired me and asked me to come the next day. After that they wanted me to figure out where the company can start collecting data from and what that data will mean for the company. At this point I was pretty frustrated because this wasn't what I was expecting. I was working extra hard for these people that I just met, and I was working to meet their expectations. I was doing a product manager + data engineer + data analyst level work as a first entry level data analyst job, because I had to figure out how to get the data out of the SQL server too. I sucked it up though. \"Life is going to be way tougher than this, all pain carves a way for you to reach satisfaction\" i thought. I gave him my plan for where we can collect the data from but he wasn't satisfied, he wanted more, he wanted all the columns that we would collect, as in all the attributes. I came back next day and now he was satisfied and asked me to start preparing the dashboard. Now the problem is that i still haven't been given the local read only access to the sql server, don't have any admin privileges in the system, don't have anyone to help me out with the engineering part, and theres a guy who wants me to present how 'data is going to change this company' at the next \"town hall\" meeting that they're having with the whole company. I am not afraid of presenting, and like to think i am pretty good at it but I am frustrated. I don't know what to do. I am clueless.\n",

      "Hello everyone, I have been living in the UK for the past 2 years where I work for the scheduling department of a private healthcare company. I also have a bachelor's degree in international relations and human rights from a European University. During my studies I have noticed many times how data could have a positive impact on many human rights‚Äô areas (for example on the allocation of humanitarian aids or how helpful would be the collection and analysis of data about human rights abuses in different areas of the world). For this reason, despite my background I would have loved to continue my studies with a master degree in data science and use this knowledge to have a positive impact on the world. Unfortunately at the moment I can't afford to pay for a master degree nor I have the right to ask for a loan (as I would need at least 3 years of residence in the country). I have a basic knowledge of Python and I took a course online about SQL but apart from that I have no knowledge about this field. I was wondering if there would be an alternative route to pursue this career or what could be the best course of action given my premises.¬†\n",

That takes 4-6hrs of human labor for a typical sample. However, there are no other meaningful expenses with the data analysis other than human time, and there's no competition in the kind of analysis I'm doing. I have some rough ideas of how much I can save clients on raw materials (USD 50k-100k / batch) but obviously the finished products are worth far more. Then there's incremental improvements. I feel that pricing an analysis for each customer will offer the most flexibility to suit their budget and needs, but I'm really at a loss as to where that price point should be.
